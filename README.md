# 👋 Hi, I'm Gihan Hemachandra  
🔐 **First-Year CS Student** | Exploring Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking | Building My Digital Defense Toolkit  

---

### 🛠️ Cybersecurity Learning Stack  
- **Languages**: Python, Bash (basic), Java  
- **Tools**: Wireshark, Nmap, Burp Suite, Kali Linux, Metasploit  
- **Learning**: Networking Fundamentals, Linux Hardening, OWASP Top 10, Port Scanning, Web App Security

---

### 🚧 Beginner-Friendly Projects & Labs  
1. 🕵️‍♂️ Port Scanner in Python — Simple scanner using `socket`  
2. 🧪 TryHackMe Labs — Realistic hands-on cyber attack/defense simulations  
3. 🐍 Python Keylogger (for learning only!) — Built in a sandboxed VM to study input logging  
4. 🔍 Wireshark Packet Analysis — Captured and analyzed suspicious traffic from a sandboxed virtual network

---

### 🎯 2025 Goals  
- Master TCP/IP, DNS, and Linux Permissions  
- Complete TryHackMe’s *Pre-Security* and *Jr Penetration Tester* paths  
- Build a personal home lab (VMs, firewalls, vulnerable apps)  
- Contribute to open-source security tools or write documentation  

---

### 🌍 Real-World Scenarios I’m Exploring  
- 🧠 How **phishing attacks** trick users and how to simulate/test them in a lab  
- 🌐 What happens when a web app has an **open port** or **misconfigured headers**  
- 🧨 How simple **reconnaissance** can lead to major data leaks  
- 📉 What kind of **log trails attackers leave** and how to detect them using tools like `fail2ban` and `Splunk`
